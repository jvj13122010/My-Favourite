        <h1>My Favourite Book</h1>
        <h2>Captain Underpants!!!</h2>
        <p>Captain Underpants is an illustrated children's novel series by American author and illustrator Dav Pilkey. The series revolves around two fourth-graders, George Beard and Harold Hutchins, living in Piqua, Ohio, and Captain Underpants, an aptly named superhero from one of the boys' homemade comic books, who accidentally ("kinda on purpose") becomes real when George and Harold hypnotize their cruel, bossy, and ill-tempered principal, Mr. Krupp. Soon after, Mr. Krupp gains superpowers by drinking alien juices in the third book.

            Currently, the series includes 12 books, two activity books, 11 spin-offs, and won a Kids' Choice Award on April 4, 2006. As of 2014, the series has been translated into more than 20 languages, with more than 80 million books sold worldwide including over 50 million in the United States.DreamWorks Animation acquired the rights to the series to make an animated feature film adaptation, which was released on June 2, 2017, to positive reviews.

            After the main series concluded with the twelfth novel, Captain Underpants and the Sensational Saga of Sir Stinks-A-Lot, in 2015, a spin-off series titled Dog Man was released the following year. This spin-off series has nine books so far.</p>
